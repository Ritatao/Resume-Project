        <h1>Wanrong Tao's Resume</h1>
        <p>
          As a native of China, I bring a cultural perspective that enriches my
          understanding of language and education. With four years of teaching
          experience in both English and Chinese, I've cultivated a deep
          appreciation for effective language instruction. Currently pursuing my
          graduate studies in Educational Technology at the University of
          Delaware, I am fueled by a passion for exploring innovative ways to
          enhance the learning experience. My ultimate goal is to contribute
          meaningfully to students' educational journeys by blending my cultural
          insights with cutting-edge educational technology.
